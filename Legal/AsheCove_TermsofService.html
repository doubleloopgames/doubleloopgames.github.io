<p><blockquote><b>14.2 Dispute Resolution</b></blockquote><blockquote><b><i>Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with Company and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</i></b></blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote><blockquote><b>(a)</b> <i>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</i> All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.</blockquote></blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote><blockquote><b>(b)</b> <i>Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution.</i> Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (&#147;<b>Notice</b>&#148;) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to Company should be sent to the Company attn.: Terms of Use Dispute at the address listed in Section 14.12 (or such other address as may be provided by the Company for this purpose. After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.</blockquote></blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote><blockquote><b>(c)</b> <i>Arbitration.</i> You agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising hereunder or relating in any way to these Terms and not informally resolved shall be settled by binding arbitration County of San Francisco in the State of California, in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (&#147;<b>JAMS</b>&#148;). The arbitrator shall issue a written decision specifying the basis for the award made. The party filing a claim or counterclaim in the arbitration proceeding shall pay the deposit(s) determined by JAMS with respect to such claim or counterclaim. All other costs associated with the arbitration and imposed by JAMS shall be paid as determined by the arbitrator(s) and, in absence of such determination, equally by each party to the arbitration. In addition, unless the arbitrator awards payment of reasonable attorney and other fees to a party, each party to the arbitration shall be responsible for its own attorneys' fees and other professional fees incurred in connection with the arbitration. Determinations of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon the parties to the arbitration, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for a judicial acceptance of the award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. The arbitrator shall apply the substantive law of the State of California, without giving effect to its conflict of laws rules.</blockquote></blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote><blockquote><b>(d)</b> <i>Waiver of Jury Trial.</i> THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</blockquote></blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote><blockquote><b>(e)</b> <i>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</i> ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.</blockquote></blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote><blockquote><b>(f)</b> <i>Confidentiality.</i> All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</blockquote></blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote><blockquote><b>(g)</b> <i>Severability.</i> If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</blockquote></blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote><blockquote><b>(h)</b> <i>Right to Waive.</i> Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.</blockquote></blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote><blockquote><b>(i)</b> <i>Emergency Equitable Relief.</i> Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.</blockquote></blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote><blockquote><b>(j)</b> <i>Claims Not Subject to Arbitration.</i> Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party&#146;s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.</blockquote></blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote><blockquote><b>(k)</b> <i>Courts.</i> In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the County of San Francisco in the State of California, for such purpose. </blockquote></blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote><b>14.3 Export</b></blockquote><blockquote>The Game may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.

<p><blockquote><b>14.5 Disclosures</b></blockquote><blockquote>The communications between you and Company use electronic means, whether you use the Game or send us emails, or whether Company posts notices on the Game or communicates with you via email. For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive communications from Company in an electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Company provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if they were to be in a hardcopy writing. The foregoing does not affect your non-waivable rights.</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote><b>14.6 Severability</b></blockquote><blockquote>If any provision of this Agreement is illegal or unenforceable under applicable law, the remainder of the provision will be amended to achieve as closely as possible the effect of the original term and all other provisions of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote><b>14.7 Governing Law</b></blockquote><blockquote>This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of California without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule.</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote><b>14.8 Limitation of Time for Claims</b></blockquote><blockquote>ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE GAME MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES OTHERWISE SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote><b>14.9 Waiver</b></blockquote><blockquote>No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of either party, any right or any power hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise of any right or power hereunder preclude further exercise of that or any other right hereunder. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and any applicable purchase or other terms, the terms of this Agreement will govern.</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote><b>14.10 Entire Terms</b></blockquote><blockquote>These Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Game. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word &#147;including&#148; means &#147;including without limitation&#148;. If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired, and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.
