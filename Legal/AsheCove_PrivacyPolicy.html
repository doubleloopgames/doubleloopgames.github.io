The names and the specific types of cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies that are used can change over time.

<p><b>Cookies: </b>small text files (typically made up of letters and numbers) that are stored in the memory of your browser or device when you visit a website or view a message. Cookies allow a game to recognize a particular device or browser.</p>
<p><b>Web beacon: </b>small images, also known as <q>pixel tags</q> or <q>clear GIFs</q>, which we may include in our websites, services, apps, messages, and tools. Generally, they work with cookies to identify our users and their activities.</p>
<p><b>Similar technologies: </b>technologies that store data in the browser or device using objects shared or stored locally, such as flash cookies, HTML 5 cookies and other software methods for web applications. These technologies work in all browsers. In some cases, the use of local storage cannot be fully handled by the browser but needs to be managed with special tools. We do not use these technologies to store information useful for creating targeted advertising on our or other games. The terms <q>cookie</q> and <q>similar technologies</q> can be used interchangeably in this policy with reference to all technologies used to store data in the browser or the user's device or to the technologies that collect data or allow the user to be identified as described above.</p>
