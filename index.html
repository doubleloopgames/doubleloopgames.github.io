              <h5>Who we are</h5>
              <p>
                We are a well-funded mobile game start-up focused on making delightful, relaxing experiences for the
                biggest audience in games: people who don’t think of themselves as gamers.
              </p>
              <p>
                We're building an environment that's transparent, respectful, and family-friendly. Our current team is
                in California and Oregon, but we're happy to work with people remotely almost anywhere in the Americas, as long as they are within 3 hours of the Pacific Time Zone. Diverse
                candidates encouraged. Kindness expected.
              </p>
              <h5>Who do we want</h5>
              <p>
                Double Loop Games is looking for an experienced mobile Development Director who will manage game development and report to our COO/Game Director.  We need someone who has a track record and passion for developing, launching, and live operating F2P mobile games, from a studio perspective. The Development Director will manage a 1-2 person Production team and 1-2 person QA team, anchor communication across the development team, manage workflow-considerations and risks, proactively identify process issues and best-practices, and help the project hit its development and product goals.  The focus of the role is on ensuring world-class development practices, team efficiency, and team cohesion, but with opportunities to contribute to the vision of some parts of the game.
              </p>
              <p>You would be a perfect match for this position if you thrive in a heavily collaborative and iterative environment, you are enthusiastic about creating smooth & efficient workflows so that the development team can work with low friction, high efficiency, high quality, and high accuracy.
              </p>
              <h5>Responsibilities</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Lead Production for a new F2P mobile title through Production, Soft Launch, World-Wide Launch, into long-term live operations.   Ensure that the game and team are prepared for smooth live launches and world-class live operations. </li>
                <li>Infuse iteration into process and communication. Optimize for the iterative, data-driven, and sometimes multi-threaded nature of mobile development.  And make sure that we regularly capture, review, and act on learnings to continuously improve our culture and processes. </li>
                <li>Work with founders and team leads to ensure that the team has clear priorities and that the game meets time, budget, and product targets.</li>
                <li>Lead the team in driving project scheduling, resource allocation, budgeting, prioritization, task tracking, and problem solving to achieve results.</li>
                <li>Oversee project schedules, productivity towards milestones, and production pathways. Monitor overall development and budgetary considerations.</li>
                <li>Raise awareness of issues, and help remove roadblocks.</li>
                <li>Identify and help alleviate any discrepancies across production efforts. Keep track of requirements and address red flags.</li>
                <li>Monitor Production's handling of feature requests and feasibility based on overall development needs.</li>
                <li>Monitor and balance workloads in order to meet budgets, timelines, and product goals, but also with great focus on minimizing friction and overages for the team. We see development of a live-operated game as a marathon, not a sprint. </li>
                <li>Manage and closely coordinate with the QA team to ensure best-practices for testing and submitting  live-operated mobile games, including versioning, test staging, cloning live accounts to test with, and more.</li>
                <li>Work with founders regarding budget, headcount, and timelines for project.</li>
                <li>Assist in the creation, organization, and maintenance of the project’s document and asset filing systems.</li>
                <li>Provide leadership to the Production & QA team with a focus on mentorship and long-term career growth.</li>
