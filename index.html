                <h5>Who we are</h5>
                <p>
                  We are a well-funded mobile game start-up focused on making delightful, relaxing experiences for the biggest audience in games: people who don’t think of themselves as gamers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We're building an environment that's transparent, respectful, and family-friendly. Our current team is in California and Oregon, but we're happy to work with people remotely anywhere in the Americas. Diverse candidates encouraged. Kindness expected.

The ideal candidate has a wealth of experience designing, testing, and tuning casual to midcore F2P gameplay systems, cinematics, levels and content. This designer will also be responsible for reviewing & giving feedback to bring a portion of the game to final polish level -- extremely high attention to detail is required. They should showcase a track record of high quality work and enthusiasm for their craft, and be experienced using Unity.

                  <li>Use Unity and our custom tools to build levels and input/configure levels and large quantities of data for content unlocks & rollout.  The Lead Game Designer will create first pass tuning, but an Economy Designer will provide final tuning</li>
                  <li>Work with a Narrative Designer and Artist to design tutorial & cinematic sequences that meld with gameplay. Review them in game, giving multiple rounds of feedback, and own the process of bringing them to final, shippable polish level</li>
                  <li>Design & iterate on content unlock & rollout</li>
                  <li>Integrate and finalize work in-engine</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Qualifications</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>4+ years industry experience</li>
                  <li>Portfolio showcasing F2P mobile games you have worked on</li>
                  <li>Ability to iterate quickly</li>
                  <li>Extreme attention to detail</li>

                  <li>Conscientious and self-motivated</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Huge plusses include:</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>Experience working in Github</li>
                  <li>Experience with pre-plnning content & mechanic rollout and difficulty curves to tune against</li>
                  <li>Experience designing, reviewing, and finalizing tutorials/narrative/cinematics</li>
                  <li>A love of relaxing, delightful gameplay, and beautiful worlds filled with both outdoor spaces and intimate village life</li>
                  <li>A strong desire to step outside of your comfort zone and learn new things</li>
                  <li>Experience managing and mentoring other designers</li>
