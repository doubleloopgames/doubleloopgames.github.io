                biggest audience in games: people who don’t think of themselves as gamers.
              </p>
              <p>
                We're building an environment that's transparent, respectful, and family-friendly. Our current team is
                in California and Oregon, but we're happy to work with people remotely almost anywhere in the Americas, as long as they are within 3 hours of the Pacific Time Zone. Diverse

The Development Director will manage a 1-2 person Production team and 1-2 person QA team, anchor communication across the development team, manage workflow-considerations and risks, proactively identify process issues and best-practices, and help the project hit its development and product goals.  The focus of the role is on ensuring world-class development practices, team efficiency, and team cohesion, but with opportunities to contribute to the vision of some parts of the game.
              </p>
              <p>You would be a perfect match for this position if you thrive in a heavily collaborative and iterative environment, you are enthusiastic about creating smooth & efficient workflows so that the development team can work with low friction, high efficiency, high quality, and high accuracy.
              </p>
              <h5>Responsibilities</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Lead Production for a new F2P mobile title through Production, Soft Launch, World-Wide Launch, into long-term live operations.   Ensure that the game and team are prepared for smooth live launches and world-class live operations. </li>
