                We're building an environment that's transparent, respectful, and family-friendly. Our current team is
                in California and Oregon, but we're happy to work with people remotely anywhere in the Americas. Diverse

                Double Loop Games is looking for an experienced Lead Game Designer to help design and implement gameplay
                interactions and levels. The ideal candidate has a wealth of experience designing, testing, and tuning
                casual to midcore F2P gameplay systems, cinematics, levels and content. This designer will also be
                responsible for reviewing & giving feedback to bring a portion of the game to final polish level --
                extremely high attention to detail is required. They should showcase a track record of high quality work
                and enthusiasm for their craft, and be experienced using Unity.

              <h5>Responsibilities</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Work with the Game Director to design F2P gameplay and metagame systems. Review and test them in
                  game, owning the feedback process of bringing them to a final, shippable polish level</li>
                <li>Use Unity and our custom tools to build levels and input/configure levels and large quantities of
                  data for content unlocks & rollout. The Lead Game Designer will create first pass tuning, but an
                  Economy Designer will provide final tuning</li>
                <li>Work with a Narrative Designer and Artist to design tutorial & cinematic sequences that meld with
                  gameplay. Review them in game, giving multiple rounds of feedback, and own the process of bringing
                  them to final, shippable polish level</li>
                <li>Design & iterate on content unlock & rollout</li>
                <li>Integrate and finalize work in-engine</li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Qualifications</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>4+ years industry experience</li>
                <li>Portfolio showcasing F2P mobile games you have worked on</li>
                <li>Ability to iterate quickly</li>
                <li>Extreme attention to detail</li>

                <li>Experience with source control</li>
                <li>Experience with Unity</li>
                <li>Experience with using playtest feedback and live player data to re-tune data</li>
                <li>Ability to communicate in English, both verbally and written</li>
                <li>Conscientious and self-motivated</li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Huge plusses</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Experience working in Github</li>
                <li>Experience with pre-planning content & mechanic rollout and difficulty curves to tune against</li>

                  intimate village life</li>
                <li>A strong desire to step outside of your comfort zone and learn new things</li>
              </ul>
              <h5>What are we offering?</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Full-time role with benefits</li>
                <li>Interesting, highly original work in a small, supportive and well-funded start-up led by two women
                  who are industry veterans</li>
                <li>Flexible working arrangements. Work from home wherever you may be as long as you have a reasonable
                  number of overlapping hours with the pacific time zone (+/- 3 hours for this role) and fast, reliable

                We're building an environment that's transparent, respectful, and family-friendly. Our current team is

               </p>
              <p>You would be a perfect match for this position if you thrive in a heavily collaborative and iterative environment, you are enthusiastic about developing testing processes, managing bug databases, and ensuring high quality launches, and you are excited by the opportunity to make a visible impact on our games.
              </p>

                <li>Help to evaluate and choose external QA vendors</li>
                <li>Manage QA resources and schedule for yourself and external test teams that will be scaled up and down through development phases</li>
                <li>Help select, and then lead an external QA test team. Act as their main point of contact, communicating their priorities and requirements, monitoring and evaluating their bug quality, and ensuring that proper workflow is followed.</li>
                <li>Review and assess compliance reports from App Stores</li>
                <li>Work with engineering to automatically generate meaningful daily reports on title quality and stability</li>
                <li>Create daily or weekly, as needed, reports summarizing title quality, stability, and issues for stakeholders </li>
